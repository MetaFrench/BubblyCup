        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Boba tea, also known as bubble tea or pearl milk tea, is a type of sweet, cold drink that originated in Taiwan in the 1980s. It is made with tea, milk, and tapioca pearls, which are small, chewy balls made from cassava root. Boba tea can be made with a variety of teas, including green, black, or oolong, and it is often flavored with syrups or fruit juices.
The name "boba" comes from the tapioca pearls, which resemble small bubbles. The tea is served with a wide straw, which is necessary to allow the tapioca pearls to be sipped along with the tea.
Boba tea has become popular around the world and can now be found in many cafes and restaurants. It is often customized with a variety of flavors and toppings, and it is enjoyed by people of all ages.</p>
